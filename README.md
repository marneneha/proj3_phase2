<ins>Required libraries 
  
 time, copy, opencv (4 and above), numpy, math and heapq


<ins>Code
  
Run code ```'roslaunch <package-name> <launch-file> <x_pos> <y_pos> <z_pos>'``` 


Enter the start position and goal position coordinate values as integers and you can also change the ```manual_input = False```


<ins>Output 

The final output is the video generated and saved on the system and it prints the total run time

<ins>Test case 1 
  
Start and Goal positions - (50,50) and (550,220)
